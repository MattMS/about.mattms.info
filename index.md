# About Matt

I do the [GitHub](https://mattms.github.com/) thing and
enjoy some [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MattMS) banter on occasion.

You may find me lurking around the [Web Dev 42](http://web.dev42.co/)
gatherings.

When things get serious, I always remain
[totally professional](http://totesprofe.sh/).


## Mostly

Helping science people through the
[Australian Antarctic Data Centre](https://www1.data.antarctica.gov.au/)
since 2010.


## And then some

[Altrove](http://altrove.totesprofe.sh/) for
[GovHack 2014](http://www.govhack.org/).

[Trapezium](http://trapezium.io/) for
[Node.js Knockout 2013](http://nodeknockout.com/).


## But also

Recognised as a [bachelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Computing)
by [UTas](http://www.utas.edu.au/).

Learned to code on a
[TRS-80 Color Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer)
but forgot to save my programs to cassette.


## I have been

Thinking in [Python](https://www.python.org/) since 2007.

Using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) with
[SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for database-driven sites.

Addicted to [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) for
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and browser scripting.

Kept happy in the browser with [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and
[Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/).

Trying to use [Redis](http://redis.io/) and
[CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) for all my storage needs.
But I know my way around [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) and
those other popular SQL databases.

Interested in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for scripting and
trying to make pretty stuff.
