# Matt?

I like to spend my time solving creative and technical issues that help people collaborate and share their work in interesting ways.

I am currently working as a freelance web developer and am always interested to hear about work that is going around.


## Where am I?

- [Codepen](http://codepen.io/MattMS/) is my playground for random ideas.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/MattMS), including [my GitHub site](http://mattms.github.com/), contains many unfinished projects.

- [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/101785614042184001303) is pretty quiet, but I do check it.

- [Keybase](https://keybase.io/mattms) may be useful to verify my other accounts.

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MattMS) is where I'm almost never serious.


## My tool belt

Thinking in [Python](https://www.python.org/) since 2007.
I like to dabble in other languages, but always have Python on hold.

Addicted to [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and browser scripting.
Also getting into functional programming with [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/).

Trying to use [Redis](http://redis.io/) and [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/)/[PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) for all my storage needs.
But I know my way around [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) and those other popular SQL databases.

Previously used [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/), and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) with [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) on a few sites.

Prefer [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) over AWS, but still [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for all the things.

Always looking for an excuse to use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and 3D on the web.


## Team work

I spent a few years helping science people at the [Australian Antarctic Division](./Australian_Antarctic_Division/).
So I get excited about geospatial and taxonomic data more than most.


## Always professional

Helped create some [totally professional](https://github.com/totesprofesh/) hacks.

[Altrove](http://altrove.totesprofe.sh/) for [GovHack 2014](http://www.govhack.org/) as an idea of a new home page for the [Trove](http://trove.nla.gov.au/) site.

[Trapezium](http://trapezium.io/) for [Node.js Knockout 2013](http://nodeknockout.com/) to discover news based on vibe.


## Human-friendly

You may find me hanging around the [Web Dev 42](http://web.dev42.co/) gatherings.
I even gave [a talk](https://mattms.github.io/WD42_CoffeeScript_talk/) there!


## But also

Recognised as a [bachelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Computing) by [UTas](http://www.utas.edu.au/).

Learned to code on a [TRS-80 Color Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer) but forgot to save my programs to cassette.

A bit of a [PlayStation](http://au.playstation.com/) fan-boy and a [Dawn of War](http://www.dawnofwar.com/) and [Fallout](https://www.fallout4.com/) gamer.
