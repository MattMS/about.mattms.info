# Matt?

I like to spend my time solving creative and technical issues that help
people collaborate and share their work in interesting ways.

This involves a lot more thinking and chatting to people than typing.


## Human-friendly

I do the [GitHub](http://mattms.github.com/) thing and
enjoy some [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MattMS) banter on occasion.
I even [think about stuff](http://thoughts.mattms.info/)!

You may find me hanging around the [Web Dev 42](http://web.dev42.co/)
gatherings.

When things get serious, I always remain
[totally professional](https://github.com/totesprofesh/).


## Mostly

Helping science people at the
[Australian Antarctic Division](./Australian_Antarctic_Division/).


## And then some

[Altrove](http://altrove.totesprofe.sh/) for
[GovHack 2014](http://www.govhack.org/)
as an idea of a new home page for the
[Trove](http://trove.nla.gov.au/) site.

[Trapezium](http://trapezium.io/) for
[Node.js Knockout 2013](http://nodeknockout.com/)
to discover news based on vibe.

Helping with various events at
[The Typewriter Factory](http://typewriterfactory.com/events/).


## I have been

Thinking in [Python](https://www.python.org/) since 2007.
I like to dabble in other languages, but always have Python on hold.

Addicted to [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) for
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and browser scripting, along with
[Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) for HTML and
[Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) for CSS.

Trying to use [Redis](http://redis.io/) and
[CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) /
[PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) for all my storage needs.
But I know my way around [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) and
those other popular SQL databases.

Using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) with
[SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for traditional sites.


## But also

Recognised as a [bachelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Computing)
by [UTas](http://www.utas.edu.au/).

Learned to code on a
[TRS-80 Color Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer)
but forgot to save my programs to cassette.

A bit of a
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/),
[Google](https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/) and
[PlayStation](http://au.playstation.com/) fan-boy.
