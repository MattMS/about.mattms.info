# About MattMS

Learn [stuff about Matt](http://about.mattms.info/) on this very
Internet!


## Setup locally

You will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/) installed.
But you should do that anyway, because they are both cool.

Install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) globally with:

	npm install -g gulp

After downloading this repo:

	npm install
	gulp
	python -m http.server 1337

Then visit [localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337).

Alternatively, [visiting the site](http://about.mattms.info/) is a lot
easier.
