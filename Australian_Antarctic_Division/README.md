# Matt at the Australian Antarctic Division

I joined the
[Australian Antarctic Data Centre](https://www1.data.antarctica.gov.au/)
in 2010.


## Interesting projects

Some of the more interesting projects I have worked on while in the Data
Centre.


### Agility + 1

I followed [Miles](https://twitter.com/miles_jordan) in helping us get
[agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).

It is difficult to describe how much this improved planning and bringing
understanding of the development process to stakeholders.


### Bootstrapped

We started a project to update the main site navigation and it turned
into a complete visual overhaul of the site.

We replaced the many different CSS styles around the site with
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (2 at the time) CSS and controls.
